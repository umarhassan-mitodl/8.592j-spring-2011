1.  Sequence comparison
    1.  Protein sequences: {{% resource_link "b63eea9e-c89e-4512-b5a6-d7431244aff2" "amino acids" %}} and their properties
    2.  Why do we need to compare sequences?
        *   Find dissimilarities
        *   Similar sequences = similar properties
        *   Similar sequences = common ancestral genes
    3.  Mutations -> Gapless alignments
    4.  Mutations, insertions and deletions -> Gapped alignment
2.  Sequence alignments
    1.  {{% resource_link "9771265f-5eef-4720-9ef8-819849836503" "Score = edit distance" %}}
    2.  Examples of scores
    3.  Length of alignment, number of alignments
3.  Algorithms for sequence alignments
    1.  Dynamics programming
    2.  Example
    3.  Global and Local alignments
4.  {{% resource_link "045c79a9-2d02-4b49-9310-cddc6ceca80f" "BLAST" %}}
    1.  How it works
    2.  Examples
